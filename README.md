Multi_Agent_Game


Co-existence of multi agent in an environment

DESCRIPTION:

A multi-agent system is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents. Multi-agent systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent or a monolithic system to solve. Intelligence may include methodic, functional, procedural approaches, algorithmic search or reinforcement learning. It is a core area of research of contemporary artificial intelligence. A multi-agent system consists of multiple decision-making agents which interact in a shared environment to achieve common or conflicting goals. A multi-agent system is simply is a form of M2M communication. To elaborate, a Multi-Agent System is a loose ecosystem of various communicating Artificial Intelligences. It is essentially the next iteration of agent-based systems. Multiple learning Agent AIs can exist in an agent-based but they never directly communicate with each other. A multi-agent system, on the other hand, is an agent-based system that involves direct communication between two or more sets of learning AIs with minimum rules.

Here the two rectangle agents will collide with each other and upon each collision the score gets calculated and once the threshold score has been reached means, the game will come to an end.
