# Multi_Agent_Game
Co-existence of multi agent in an environment

DESCRIPTION:

A multi-agent system is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents.
Multi-agent systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent or a
monolithic system to solve. Intelligence may include methodic, functional, procedural approaches,
algorithmic search or reinforcement learning. It is a core area of research of contemporary artificial
intelligence. A multi-agent system consists of multiple decision-making agents which interact in a shared
environment to achieve common or conflicting goals. A multi-agent system is simply is a form of M2M
communication. To elaborate, a Multi-Agent System is a loose ecosystem of various communicating
Artificial Intelligences. It is essentially the next iteration of agent-based systems. Multiple learning Agent
AIs can exist in an agent-based but they never directly communicate with each other. A multi-agent
system, on the other hand, is an agent-based system that involves direct communication between two or
more sets of learning AIs with minimum rules.


Here the two rectangle agents will collide with each other and upon each collision the score gets calculated and 
once the threshold score has been reached means, the game will come to an end.
